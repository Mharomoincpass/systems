      <h3>How These AI Models Generate Responses</h3>
      <p>
        Modern AI chat tools use Large Language Models (LLMs). These models are the engine behind the chat. They power the conversation and make it feel real.

        These models learn from huge amounts of text. This training helps them understand language patterns. They learn grammar, facts, and reasoning skills.
      </p>
      <p>
        The answers you get depend on your questions. Clear prompts lead to better, more helpful replies. Context from the chat also helps the AI give the right answers.
